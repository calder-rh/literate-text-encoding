As the child of two artists and designers, I have learned to be deliberate about looking. I grew up in a family that appreciates the beauty in the forms around us: a peach in a light blue bowl, a truss bridge, a pattern of light on the wall. My household was full of making, full of exciting conversations about ideas: I spent my childhood reading math books, visiting the science museum where my dad worked, asking my mom to explain the news in detail because I loved complicated things; making ambigrams, geometric abstractions, a new phonetic spelling system, a Sol LeWitt-like grid showing every combination of ROYGBIV colors.

These were the projects that occupied me in elementary school. To make more space for me to learn and create at the depth and pace I needed, my family decided to homeschool in middle and high school. This experience made me comfortable charting my own path and seeking out diverse resources — a mindset indispensable for the interdisciplinary work I pursue. Today I continue to follow the same threads of form, system, language, and meaning that have fascinated me from the beginning.

When I was young, my parents had to explain many aspects of social interaction to my presumably neurodivergent brain. Our conversations delved into the details and structures of relationships, with my mother contributing her deep insight as a psychotherapist. From these experiences I developed a habit of self-reflection, as I wish to have clarity about my inner workings and to act with integrity. Indeed I need to break down my experiences and analyze what’s going on at their core for me to feel on solid ground. I try to approach relationships deliberately: in my friendships and communities, I try to help people stay connected; in my family, my mother and I still work together to understand interpersonal dynamics. Clear, direct communication is sacrosanct for us, and I try to carry this value everywhere.

These principles — good communication, self-understanding, empathy — shape how I engage with systems and ideas. When I’m on a walk or doing chores, I tend to occupy myself by teaching to imaginary people: analyzing how some idea is structured in my mind and figuring out how I could build this structure for others. When I’m explaining something, I try to anticipate what concepts might be intimidating and prepare a foundation of understanding that allows these concepts to land comfortably. Some of the work I am most proud of has involved this kind of thinking: proofs for math courses, educational stop-motion videos, a guide to online friendships. In classes, as a TA or peer, I try to be attuned to others’ learning; many teachers and students have expressed appreciation for the questions and reframings I pose to clarify concepts. A good explanation has beauty to me, as significant as the beauty of a visual form or abstract system. All these things are my guides as I navigate my life and develop my work.
